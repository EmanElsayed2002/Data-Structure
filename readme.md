# Data Structure


## What is Data Structure?
A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively. For example, we can store a list of items having the same data-type using the array data structure.

## Types of Data Structure
1. Linear Data Structure
2. Non-Linear Data Structure

## Linear Data Structure
Linear data structures are those data structures which store data in a sequential manner. The data elements are connected linearly to each other. The order is important and each element is connected to exactly one successor and one predecessor. The most common examples of linear data structures are arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, etc.

## Non-Linear Data Structure
Non-linear data structures are those data structures where data elements are not connected to each other in a sequential manner. The data elements in non-linear data structures are connected to more than one data elements. The most common examples of non-linear data structures are trees, graphs, etc.

## Advantages of Data Structure
1. Better organization of data
2. More efficient access and modifications
3. More effective use of computer memory

## Disadvantages of Data Structure
1. Implementation of data structure is not always easy
2. Data structure is not always the best solution to a problem
